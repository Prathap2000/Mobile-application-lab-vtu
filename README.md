##Fingerprint Authentication App

#Description
This is an Android application that demonstrates fingerprint authentication using the BiometricPrompt API. The app allows users to authenticate using their device's fingerprint sensor and provides feedback based on the authentication result.

#Features

Biometric authentication: Users can log in using their fingerprint.
Error handling: Appropriate messages are displayed for various authentication scenarios (e.g., no fingerprint sensor, sensor unavailable, etc.).

#User feedback: Toast messages inform users about the authentication status.
Requirements
Android device with a fingerprint sensor
Android SDK 28 or higher
Android Studio (or any compatible IDE)
Installation


#Usage
Launch the app on your Android device.
Follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate using your fingerprint.
If your device supports fingerprint authentication and your fingerprint is enrolled, you should be able to log in successfully.
If authentication fails or encounters errors, appropriate messages will be displayed.


#Known Issues
No known issues at the moment.
#Future Enhancements
Support for additional authentication methods (e.g., face recognition).
Improved error handling and user feedback.
